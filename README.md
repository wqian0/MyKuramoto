Investigates how time-varying connectivity affects synchronization phenomena in networks of coupled oscillators with inertia.  

Below is a phase space animation of 100 inertial oscillators undergoing the following network rewiring pathway:

randomly connected graph -> synchrony-aligned graph -> original randomly connected graph.
